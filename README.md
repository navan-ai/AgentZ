Digital Worker: A Digital Worker is a software that can carry out a specific task.

How an Agent is different from Digital Worker?
An Agent can understand the context, can store information, can understand instructions in natural language. However a Digital Worker can carry out a specific task based on the instructions given but may not understand natural language and context.
